<!--
    The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    After we declare the doctype, we need to provide an <html> element. 
    This is what’s known as the root element of the document, 
    meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.

    lang specifies the language of the text content in that element.
    This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages,
    and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.
    Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.
-->
<head>
    <!--
        UTF-8 encoding is very important because 
        it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        The http-equiv attribute specifies an HTTP header that is equivalent to a specific HTML meta tag.
        In this case, X-UA-Compatible is the HTTP header that defines how the browser should render the page.
        The content attribute specifies the value for the HTTP header, which in this case is set to "IE=edge".
        The value "IE=edge" tells Internet Explorer to use the latest version of its rendering engine to display the web page.
    -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <!--
        The name attribute specifies the name of the meta tag.
        The viewport meta tag is used to control how the web page is displayed on different devices and screen sizes.
        The content attribute specifies the settings for the viewport.
        In this case, width=device-width sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device.
        initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.

        The title element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpage’s browser tab.

    This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.
